* Areas of Interest
  - Computer Graphics
  - Natural Language Processing
  - Modelling Natural Processes

* Code

-  [[https://github.com/RvanB/RomBox][RomBox]] :: A lightweight launcher for emulators and games, with playtime
   tracking.


-  [[https://github.com/cabeese/greatpuzzlehunt][The Great Puzzle Hunt]] :: The website for [[https://greatpuzzlehunt.com][The Great Puzzle Hunt]], an annual team-puzzling event

- [[https://github.com/RvanB/Rock-Generator][Rock Generator]] :: One of my early explorations of computer graphics
     through software rendering. Renders "rocks" (spheres with noise
     applied) with shading, support for multiple colored lights,
     supersampling, and optimizations such as backface culling and
     multithreaded rasterization. Also calculates the volume of the
     rock with parallelepipeds.
